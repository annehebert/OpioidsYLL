This file contains instructions for downloading the data files used in YearsLifeLost.R to estimate the years of life lost and the life expectancy reduction by demographic group, and in YLL_state.R to estimate the years of life lost by state. First are the instructions for downloading the death counts from CDC WONDER, and at the bottom are the instructions for the NVSS life tables.


CDC WONDER multiple cause of death database download instructions:
